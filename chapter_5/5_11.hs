-- The general rule for where an arithmetic sequence will end depends on whether the sequence elements are of type Int or type Float/Double:

-- Whole Numbers (Int): The sequence stops before exceeding the end value. The list includes all values up to but not exceeding the end value, respecting the step size.

-- Floating-Point Numbers (Float/Double): The sequence may include values beyond the specified end value due to floating-point precision. It often includes the end value and potentially values just beyond it, depending on the step size and precision.
